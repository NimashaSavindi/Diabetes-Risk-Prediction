**Diabetes-Risk-Prediction**__

**Case Study Overview:**
Early detection of diabetes is crucial for preventing severe health complications. However, current prediction methods face challenges in accuracy and fairness.

**Problem Statement:**
Imbalanced datasets cause poor prediction for actual diabetes cases (minority class).
Equal weighting of all features ignores the importance of critical symptoms.

**Project Objectives:**
To collect user lifestyle and health data for personalized risk analysis.
To develop an intelligent system to assess diabetes risk.
To enable early detection for better prevention and management.
To build and train a predictive model to estimate diabetes risk levels.

**Target Population:**
Only the students from Rajarata University of Sri Lanka.
